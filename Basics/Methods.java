// A method is a collection of code outside of the main method that preform a certain task
// A method can be called with specific parameters
// A method looks like this: 
// <AccessModifier> <ReturnType> <methodName>(<ParameterType> <Parameter>) {
//     // <code>
// }

// the AccessModifier is either public (if you want other files to access it), or private
// The ReturnType is the either the datatype you want your function to return
// (for example an int or a string or a double) or "void", which means the function doesn't return
// anything 
// Methods are used in order to stop writing the same line of code over and over again,
// for example you can make a method to add two numbers together
// at a high level of programming this saves a ton of time, formatting, and grunt work
