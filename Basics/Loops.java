public class Loops {
    // There are several types of loops
    // There's the while loop
    // a while loops is written like this:
    // while(<condition>) {
    //      <code>
    // }
    // a while loop will run the code inside it until the condition specified is false
    // then it will move on to the code written after the while loop

    // another, more common type of loop is a for loop, which looks like this:
    // for (int i = <value>; <condition>; <operator on i>) {
        // code
    // }
    // a for loop works by initializing a value, and then generally changing that value
    // (the operator) by a certain amount every time the code inside runs
    // until that value meets a certain condition
    // for example the code:
    // for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    //      System.out.println(i);
    // }
    // will print out the value 0-9 by printing i every iteration of the loop

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sumFor = 0;
        int sumWhile = 0;
        // create a while loop that adds up the numbers from 1-10 (should be 55)
        // and then print out the total


        // do the exact same thing with a for loop
    }
    // which solution was easier?
